This is a flexible Donation Smart Contract
The Creater is able to collect donations with this Smart Contract

The donators have the following options:
1) Donate(): They send a certain amount as donation - there is no way back
2) DonateWithoutLockin(): The place a donation - but this donation dont gets locked in. The donator still has the option to 'withdraw' the donation. 
   The Donation is only parked in the smart contract. (Should be seen as an incentive - I am willing to donate but first show me something)
3) WithdrawDonation(): The donator is able to withdraw his not locked in donation
4) LockInDonations(): The donator is locking in his 'pending' donation
5) OwnerTransferDonations(Address address): The owner of the smart contract is able to move the donations to an other wallet
